# Advanced Energy Generation Modeling
 CCT College Dublin Continuous Assessment | Assignment Title: Machine Learning Project_Semester1

 Assessment Task
This is a group-based project (Max 3 students) using the PYTHON programming language. Develop and
deploy machine learning models in any one of the following areas only and analyse the results.
– Population and Society
– Energy & Environment
– Economy and Finance
You can find any public dataset from an authentic resource repository and the dataset should have at least
3000 rows and 10 columns after cleaning and there is not any upper bound.
The type of question(s) that you should formulate for the project will depend on the chosen area of the
dataset that your group is considering for the machine learning project.
Suggested possible analysis / project questions are mentioned below (this is a small, suggested, sample of
questions, other questions may be more appropriate to your project)
o What are the most important features for predicting X as a target variable?
o Which classification approach do you prefer for the prediction of X as a target variable, and why?
o How to classify the loyal and churn customers using Support Vector Machines?
o Why is dimensionality reduction important in machine learning?
The group would need to consider the following instructions (a - d) during the development of this group
project.
a) Logical justification based on the reasoning for the specific choice of machine learning approaches.
b) Multiple machine learning approaches (at least two) using hyperparameters and a comparison
between the chosen modelling approaches.
c) Visualise your comparison of ML modelling outcomes. You may use a statistical approach to argue that
one feature is more important than other features (for example, using PCA).
d) Cross-validation methods should be used to justify the authenticity of your ML results.
Your group will present their findings and defend the results in the report (MS Doc/ pdf or any other
readable format) by highlighting their individual contribution. Your report should capture the following
aspects that are relevant to your project investigations.
